This was a class project I made in CS 498 Cloud Computing Application.

Having developed one of the best image classification neural networks out there, it is now time to provide it as an online service and capture some market share. To do so, I set up and manage the infrastructure using Kubernetes and Docker containers over a cluster of nodes in this project.

Virtualization helped us effectively provision our hardware resources and achieve isolation between different executions. Moreover, we could easily deploy our neural network in any of our nodes without worrying about the environment, dependencies, etc.
